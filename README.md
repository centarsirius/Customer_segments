# Customer_segments
In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. We’ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

# Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Identify customers segments 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Solution is provided in the `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb` notebook file. 

### Data

The actual data was removed due to terms and conditions of AZ Direct GmbH which prohibits of using data in any other content rather than Udacity course. 

### Results 

Within the project both general population (Germany) and customers population were compared. Segments were identified that could be target for future marketing campaigns or to be considered outside of company interests. Typical portrait of a customer for different segments was described.
